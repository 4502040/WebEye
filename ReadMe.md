WebEye is a collection of .NET controls. So far, the collection consists of two controls:

1. StreamPlayerControl is a FFmpeg-based stream player control
2. WebCameraControl is a DirectShow-based web camera control 

The controls are simple and easy to use, have no additional dependencies and a minimalistic interface.
